# GPS Coordinates Distance Calculator
This Java program calculates the distance between two GPS coordinates specified by longitude and latitude using the Haversine formula. The Haversine formula is used to compute the shortest distance between two points on the surface of a sphere, which is particularly useful for calculating distances on the Earth's surface.

# Note
This code assumes that the Earth is a perfect sphere with a radius of 6371 kilometers, which is an approximation. For more accurate results, you may need to consider the Earth's ellipsoidal shape and use more complex formulas.
